Something went wrong on executing Code: `# The data is empty, so we cannot proceed with identifying the oldest impressionist artwork.
data = {'status': 'success', 'data': []}

# Save the data to the specified path
output_path = '/home/ubuntu/workspace/XMODE-LLMCompiler/ceasura_langgraph/experiments/log//0'
with open(output_path, 'w') as file:
    file.write(str(data))`. This is the error I got: `IsADirectoryError: [Errno 21] Is a directory: '/home/ubuntu/workspace/XMODE-LLMCompiler/ceasura_langgraph/experiments/log//0'`. \ Can you fixed the problem and write the fixed python code?
