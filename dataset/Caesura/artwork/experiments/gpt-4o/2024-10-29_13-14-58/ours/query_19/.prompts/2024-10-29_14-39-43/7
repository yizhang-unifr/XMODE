HumanMessage: convert the year to century by dividing the year by 100 and taking the ceiling of the result.:
```py
>>> print(year[:10])
0    1438
1    1525
2    1528
3    1536
4    1536
5    1536
6    1536
7    1536
8    1536
9    1536
Name: year, dtype: int64
```
It is a pandas Series object. Please call the 'apply' method with a lambda expression, and make sure to always call astype() in the same line. Assign the result to a variable called 'century'. Template to use: `century = year.apply(lambda x: <code>).astype(<dtype>)`. You can use pandas, datetime, numpy, re.

To convert the year to a century by dividing the year by 100 and taking the ceiling of the result, you can use the `numpy` library's `ceil` function. Here's how you can achieve this using the `apply` method with a lambda expression and the `astype` method:

```python
import numpy as np

century = year.apply(lambda x: np.ceil(x / 100)).astype(int)
```

This code will convert each year in the `year` Series to its corresponding century and store the result in the `century` variable as an integer.
