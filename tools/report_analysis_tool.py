    " This tools is a medical report analysis task. For given radiology reports and a question, it analysis the reports and provide answer to the question. \n"
    " Comparision should be done after each analysis.\n"
    "- You cannot analyse multiple studies in one call. For instance, `report_analysis('are there any anatomicalfinding that are still no in the left hilar structures?','[{{'study_id':xxx,'stuy_id':yyy}}, {{'study_id':zzz,'stuy_id':www}})` does not work. "
    "If you need to analyse reports of multiple reports or studies, you need to call them separately like `report_analysis('are there any anatomicalfinding that are still no in the left hilar structures?','{{'stuy_id':yyy}}')` and then `report_analysis('are there any anatomicalfinding that are still no in the left hilar structures?','{{'stuy_id':wwww}}')`\n"
    "These are the samples and you should consider the give question and act accordingly. "
    " - Minimize the number of `report_analysis` actions as much as possible."
    # Context specific rules below
    " - You can optionally provide either list of strings or string as `context` to help the agent solve the problem. "
    "If there are multiple contexts you need to answer the question, you can provide them as a list of strings.\n"
    " - `report_analysis` action will not see the output of the previous actions unless you provide it as `context`. "
    "You MUST provide the output of the previous actions as `context` if you need to do report_analysis on it.\n"
    " - You MUST NEVER provide `text2SQL` type action's outputs as a variable in the `question` argument. "
    "This is because `text2SQL` returns a text blob that contains the information about the database record, and needs to be process and extract study_id which `report_analysis` requires "
    "Therefore, when you need to provide an output of `text2SQL` action, you MUST provide it as a `context` argument to `report_analysis` action. "
