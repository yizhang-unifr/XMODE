The database contains the following tables:
 - paintings_metadata = table(num_rows=101, columns=['title': 'str', 'inception': 'str', 'movement': 'str', 'genre': 'str', 'image_url': 'str', 'img_path': 'str'], primary_key='title', description='a table that contains general information about paintings', foreign_keys=[paintings_metadata.img_path -> painting_images.img_path])
 - painting_images = table(num_rows=101, columns=['img_path': 'str', 'image': 'IMAGE'], primary_key='img_path', description='a table that contains images of paintings', foreign_keys=[])

A column with the IMAGE datatype stores images. A column with the TEXT datatype stores long text.

You have the following capabilities:
You are able to look at images (columns of type IMAGE). For example, you are able to do things like:
 - Recognize the objects depicted in images. E.g. You can determine in which images a skateboard is depicted.
 - Recognize the style of the image. E.g. You can determine whether the image is a photograph or pixel art or ...
 - You can count the number of objects of a certain type. E.g. You can count all marbles depicted in an image.
 - You can look at images both to add new columns to a table (e.g. num_marbles) or to select rows based on images (e.g. all rows where image depicts a skateboard).
 - ...
 Template 1: Extract <what to extract from each individual image, e.g. the number of marbles depicted> for each image in <column, e.g. images>.
 Template 2: Select all rows where <column, e.g. images> depicts <description about what should be depicted>.

You are able to read and understand longer texts (columns of type TEXT). For example, you are able to do things like:
 - Extract relevant information from texts. E.g. in a patient report, you can extract the patient, diagnosis, treatment, ...
 - You can read texts both to add new columns to a table (e.g. diagnosis) or to select rows based on the text (e.g. all rows where diagnosis is fever).
 - ...
Template: Extract <what to extract from each individual text, e.g. the age / diagnosis / treatment> for each <class of entity, e.g. patient> from <column, e.g. patient_report in table joined_patient_table>.

You are able to transform the values in a column. For example, you are able to do things like:
 - In a column containing dates, you are able to extract the day, month, year etc.
 - In a column containing names, you are able to transform all strings to upper case, lower case etc.
 - ....
Template 1: Extract <what to extract from each individual value, e.g. the year> from each value in <column, e.g. date_of_birth>.
Template 2: Transform the values in <column, e.g. name> to <description of transformation, e.g. lower case>

You are able to manipulate the tables in a SQL like manner. For example you are able to:
- Select rows that match a certain criterion. E.g. You can select all rows where the value of a column is larger than a threshold, an image column depicts a skateboard or the text is a patient report. Per step, you are only allowed to select based on a single column.
- Project columns to dismiss irrelevant columns.
- Join two tables to combine them. You can do all typical joins, like inner joins, left joins, right joins etc.
- Aggregate rows. E.g. You can group a patients table based on their diagnosis to compute the average age for each diagnosis.
Template: <Select/Project/Join/Group> <description of operation>

You are able to produce plots if the user requests one. You can produce bar plots, scatter plots and line plots.
In order to produce a plot, the data must be prepared using the other tools. The input for plotting is a table with two columns and one of those columns will be plotted on the X-Axis and the other on the Y-Axis.
Template: Plot the <table name, e.g. result_table> table in a bar plot. The <column X, e.g. diagnosis> should be on the X-axis and the <column Y, e.g. mean_age> on the Y-Axis.


Use the following format:
Request: The user request you must satisfy by using your capabilities
Thought: You should always think what to do.
Step 1: Description of the step.
Input: List of tables passed as input. Usually this is a single table, except when tables need to be combined using a join.
Output: Name of the output table. N/A if there is no output e.g. when plotting.
New Columns: The new columns that have been added to the dataset. N/A if no column has been added.
... (this Step/Input/Output/New Columns can repeat N times)
Step N: Plan completed.

AIMessage: To find the oldest impressionist artwork, I need to filter the paintings based on the 'movement' column to select only those that are classified as 'impressionism'. Then, I will sort these paintings by the 'inception' date to find the oldest one.

Step 1: Select all rows from the 'paintings_metadata' table where the 'movement' column is 'impressionism'.
Input: paintings_metadata
Output: impressionist_paintings
New Columns: N/A

Step 2: Sort the 'impressionist_paintings' table by the 'inception' column in ascending order to find the oldest artwork.
Input: impressionist_paintings
Output: sorted_impressionist_paintings
New Columns: N/A

Step 3: Select the first row from the 'sorted_impressionist_paintings' table to get the oldest impressionist artwork.
Input: sorted_impressionist_paintings
Output: oldest_impressionist_artwork
New Columns: N/A

Step 4: Plan completed.

HumanMessage: Something went wrong in Step 1! ExecutionError(Something went wrong! Empty table encountered. Check your filter or join conditions.). An error occurred while executing SQL. 
This is how it can be fixed: Explain in detail how this error could be fixed.

To fix this error, we should first verify the distinct values present in the 'movement' column of the 'paintings_metadata' table to ensure that 'impressionism' is indeed a valid value. If it is not present, we need to adjust the filter condition accordingly. 
To systematically fix this issue, answer the following questions one by one:
1. What are potential causes for this error? Think step by step.
2. Explain in detail how this error could be fixed.
3. Are there additional relevant columns necessary to fix the error(Yes / No)?

************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
1. What are potential causes for this error? Think step by step.
   - The 'movement' column in the 'paintings_metadata' table might not contain the value 'impressionism', which would result in an empty table when filtering for this specific movement.
   - There might be a typo or variation in the way 'impressionism' is recorded in the database (e.g., different capitalization, spelling errors, or additional spaces).
   - The 'paintings_metadata' table might not have any entries at all, or it might not have entries with a valid 'movement' value.

2. Explain in detail how this error could be fixed.
   - First, we should check the distinct values present in the 'movement' column of the 'paintings_metadata' table to confirm whether 'impressionism' is a valid entry. This can be done by querying the distinct values in the 'movement' column.
   - If 'impressionism' is not present, we should look for similar terms or variations that might represent the same art movement (e.g., 'Impressionism', 'impressionist', etc.).
   - Once the correct term is identified, we should adjust the filter condition in Step 1 to use the correct value.
   - If no relevant term is found, it might indicate that there are no impressionist artworks in the database, and the request cannot be fulfilled with the current data.

3. Are there additional relevant columns necessary to fix the error(Yes / No)?
   - No, the current columns ('movement', 'inception', 'title') are sufficient to address the issue. The focus should be on verifying and correcting the filter condition based on the 'movement' column.
