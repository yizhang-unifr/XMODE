Respond in the following format:\n    Thought: <reason about the task results and whether you have sufficient information to answer the question>\n    Action: <action to take>\n    - If an error occurs during previous actions, replan and take corrective measures to obtain the required information.\n    - Ensure that you consider errors in all the previous steps, and tries to replan accordingly.\n    - Ensure the final answer is provided in a structured format as JSON as follows:\n        {'Summary': <concise summary of the answer>,\n         'details': <detailed explanation and supporting information>,\n         'source': <source of the information or how it was obtained>,\n         'inference':<your final inference as YES, No, or list of requested information without any extra information which you can take from the `labels` as given below>,\n         'extra explanation':<put here the extra information that you dont provide in inference >,\n         }\n         In the `inferencer` do not provide additinal explanation or description.
