SystemMessage: You are Data-GPT, and you execute informal query plans using a set of tools:
The database contains the following tables:
 - paintings_metadata = table(num_rows=101, columns=['title': 'str', 'inception': 'str', 'movement': 'str', 'genre': 'str', 'image_url': 'str', 'img_path': 'str'], primary_key='title', description='a table that contains general information about paintings', foreign_keys=[paintings_metadata.img_path -> painting_images.img_path])
 - painting_images = table(num_rows=101, columns=['img_path': 'str', 'image': 'IMAGE'], primary_key='img_path', description='a table that contains images of paintings', foreign_keys=[])

A column with the IMAGE datatype stores images. A column with the TEXT datatype stores long text.

You can use the following tools:
Image Select: It is useful for when you want to select tuples based on what is depicted in images (column with IMAGE datatype) e.g. to select all rows where the image depicts a skateboard. Two input arguments: (column with IMAGE datatype; the description to match), e.g. (image; skateboard). The tool selects the tuples where the images match the description. It will not add new columns to the table.

Visual Question Answering: It is useful for when you want to know what is depicted on the images in a column with IMAGE datatype. It is Data-GPTs way of looking at images. The input to the tool is: (name of column with IMAGE datatype; name of new column with extracted info; question; datatype to automatically cast the result column to [string, int, float, date, boolean]), e.g. (image; breed_of_dog; What is the breed of dog?; string). The tool adds a new column to the table with the extracted information (e.g. [Poodle, Chihuahua, ...]). The question can be anything that can be answered by looking at an image: E.g. How many <x> are depicted? Is <y> depicted? What is in the background? ...

SQL: Useful for when you want to query tables using SQL in SQLite syntax. The input to the tool is: (query referencing tables in the database). The result of the tool is the result table of the SQL query. For example if you want to combine two tables, you can join them using a SQL query. If you want to an aggregation, you can issue a SQL-Query using GROUP BY, etc.

Python: Transform the values for a certain column using python. Can be used to transform dates, numbers etc, or to extract data from semi-structured documents. Three input arguments: (column to transform; new name for the transformed column; natural language explanation of the python code to be executed). For example: (date_of_birth; month_of_birth; extract the month from the dates) Cannot deal columns of type IMAGE or TEXT. Cannot filter rows. Has only access to the libraries pandas,datetime,numpy,re.

Plot: Plot the results, if the user asks for a plot. Three input arguments (Type of Plot [scatter, line, bar]; column on x axis; column on y axis). Unfortunately, is it not possible to customize the labels, color, title, axes etc.

Text Question Answering: It is useful for when you want to extract information from texts inside of columns of TEXT datatype. It is Data-GPTs way of reading texts. Four input arguments: (name of column with TEXT datatype; name of new column; question_template; datatype), e.g. (patient_report; diagnosis; What is the diagnosis of <patient_name>?; string), where 'patient_name' is a column from the same table as patient_report. The question_template can be anything that can be answered by reading a text. Importantly, the question_template is a template, and must reference columns from the same table in <>. The values from this column will then be inserted into the question. The tool will automatically convert the extracted information to the specified datatype [should be one of string, int, float, date, boolean]. The tool adds a new column to the table with the extracted information (e.g. [fever, sore throat, ...]) from each individual text.

No Op: Does not perform any operation. Useful when you should extract a column from the table, but this column already exists. E.g. Step X: Extract name from persons --> Column name already exists in Table persons. Hence, no operation necessary.

Use the following output format:
Step <i>: What to do in this step?
Reasoning: Reason about which tool should be used for this step. Take datatypes into account.
Tool: The tool to use, should be one of [Image Select, Visual Question Answering, SQL, Python, Plot, Text Question Answering, No Op]
Arguments: The arguments to call the tool, separated by ';'. Should be (arg_1; ...; arg_n)
(if you need more than one tool for this step, follow up with another Tool + Arguments.)

HumanMessage: Execute the steps one by one. These columns (among others) are potentially relevant:
- The 'inception' column of the 'paintings_metadata' table might be relevant. The column `inception` in the table `paintings_metadata` contains the inception dates of the paintings, formatted as strings. These are some relevant values for the column: ['1438-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1525-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1528-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1536-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1500-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1520-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1530-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1565-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1470-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1475-01-01T00:00:00Z'].
- The 'genre' column of the 'paintings_metadata' table might be relevant. The column `genre` in the table `paintings_metadata` contains the genre of each painting. These are some relevant values for the column: ['portrait', 'religious art', 'genre art', 'nude', 'figure painting', 'mythological painting', 'history painting', 'Hodegetria', 'allegory', 'interior view'].
- The 'image' column of the 'painting_images' table might be relevant. The column `image` in the table `painting_images` contains the actual image data of the paintings. These are some relevant values for the column: ["<IMAGE stored at 'datasets/art/images/img_89.jpg'>", "<IMAGE stored at 'datasets/art/images/img_41.jpg'>", "<IMAGE stored at 'datasets/art/images/img_19.jpg'>"]. Use Visual Question Answering to look at the images in painting_images.image and extract information. Use Image Select to filter rows by what is depicted on the images.
- The 'img_path' column of the 'painting_images' table might be relevant. The column `img_path` in the table `painting_images` contains file paths to the images of paintings. These are some relevant values for the column: ['datasets/art/images/img_89.jpg', 'datasets/art/images/img_41.jpg', 'datasets/art/images/img_19.jpg', 'datasets/art/images/img_28.jpg', 'datasets/art/images/img_30.jpg', 'datasets/art/images/img_82.jpg', 'datasets/art/images/img_10.jpg', 'datasets/art/images/img_70.jpg', 'datasets/art/images/img_35.jpg', 'datasets/art/images/img_25.jpg'].
. Take these into account when executing the tools.
Step 1: Join the 'paintings_metadata' and 'painting_images' tables on the 'img_path' column to combine the metadata with the images. The input to this step are the paintings_metadata, painting_images tables.

--
AIMessage: Step 1: Join the 'paintings_metadata' and 'painting_images' tables on the 'img_path' column to combine the metadata with the images.
Reasoning: To combine the metadata of the paintings with their corresponding images, we need to perform a join operation on the 'img_path' column, which is the common key between the two tables.
Tool: SQL
Arguments: SELECT * FROM paintings_metadata JOIN painting_images ON paintings_metadata.img_path = painting_images.img_path

--
HumanMessage: Observation. Table joined_table has been added.
The table joined_table has these columns: ['title', 'inception', 'movement', 'genre', 'image_url', 'img_path', 'image']
The table joined_table has 101 rows.

HumanMessage: Step 2: Select all rows where the 'image' column depicts fruit. The input to this step is the 'joined_table' table.

--
AIMessage: Step 2: Select all rows where the 'image' column depicts fruit.
Reasoning: To filter the rows based on the depiction of fruit in the images, we should use the Image Select tool, which allows us to select tuples based on the content of images.
Tool: Image Select
Arguments: (image; fruit)

--
HumanMessage: Something went wrong in Step 2! Empty table encountered. Check your filter or join conditions. 
This is how it can be fixed: Explain in detail how this error could be fixed.
   - Verify that the images in the dataset actually contain depictions of fruit. This can be done by using the Visual Question Answering tool to explicitly check if fruit is depicted in each image.
   - If the dataset does contain images of fruit, ensure that the Image Select tool is being used correctly and that the description provided is appropriate for the tool to recognize the images. 
Please restart from Step 1
