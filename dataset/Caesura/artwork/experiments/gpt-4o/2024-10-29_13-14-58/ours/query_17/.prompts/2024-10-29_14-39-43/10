SystemMessage: You are Data-GPT, and you can tell users which database tables and columns are relevant for a user request. You can look at images (Datatype IMAGE) to determine which and how many objects are depicted in the image, and also determine things like the style and type of the image. You can read and process texts (Datatype TEXT) to extract information from the text. You cannot open file paths or URLs.
The database contains the following tables:
 - paintings_metadata = table(num_rows=101, columns=['title': 'str', 'inception': 'str', 'movement': 'str', 'genre': 'str', 'image_url': 'str', 'img_path': 'str'], primary_key='title', description='a table that contains general information about paintings', foreign_keys=[paintings_metadata.img_path -> painting_images.img_path])
 - painting_images = table(num_rows=101, columns=['img_path': 'str', 'image': 'IMAGE'], primary_key='img_path', description='a table that contains images of paintings', foreign_keys=[])

A column with the IMAGE datatype stores images. A column with the TEXT datatype stores long text.

HumanMessage: My request is: Get the number of paintings that depict Animals for each movement. I consider these columns as relevant: paintings_metadata.img_path (What is contained in column img_path (table paintings_metadata, datatype str)?. Why or why not is column paintings_metadata.img_path relevant for the query?), paintings_metadata.inception (What is contained in column inception (table paintings_metadata, datatype str)?. Why or why not is column paintings_metadata.inception relevant for the query?), paintings_metadata.title (What is contained in column title (table paintings_metadata, datatype str)?. Why or why not is column paintings_metadata.title relevant for the query?), paintings_metadata.movement (What is contained in column movement (table paintings_metadata, datatype str)?. Why or why not is column paintings_metadata.movement relevant for the query?), paintings_metadata.image_url (What is contained in column image_url (table paintings_metadata, datatype str)?. Why or why not is column paintings_metadata.image_url relevant for the query?), paintings_metadata.genre (What is contained in column genre (table paintings_metadata, datatype str)?. Why or why not is column paintings_metadata.genre relevant for the query?), painting_images.image (The column `image` in the table `painting_images` contains the actual image data of the paintings. The column `painting_images.image` is relevant for the query because it allows for the analysis of the images to identify whether they depict animals, which is necessary to fulfill the request.), painting_images.img_path (The column `img_path` in the table `painting_images` contains file paths to the images of paintings. The column `painting_images.img_path` is relevant for the query because it serves as a link to access the actual images stored in the `painting_images` table, which can be analyzed to determine if they depict animals.). Answer these questions:
1. Are these columns enough to satisfy the request or are there other relevant columns I missed? If they are sufficient, you can skip the other questions.
2. Which other columns are relevant? Please provide them in this format:
- table_1.col_1: <What does the column contain?>
...
- table_n.col_n: <What does the column contain?>

AIMessage: The columns you have identified are sufficient to satisfy the request. They allow for the analysis of images to determine if they depict animals and provide the necessary metadata to group the results by movement. Therefore, there are no other relevant columns needed for this query.

************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
Let's go through the columns again to ensure all relevant information is covered:

1. **paintings_metadata.img_path**: This column contains file paths to the images of paintings. It is relevant because it links to the `painting_images` table, allowing access to the actual images for analysis.

2. **paintings_metadata.inception**: This column contains the inception date of the paintings. It is not directly relevant for the query, as the request is focused on identifying paintings depicting animals and grouping them by movement, not by date.

3. **paintings_metadata.title**: This column contains the titles of the paintings. It is not directly relevant for the query, as the request does not require identifying paintings by title.

4. **paintings_metadata.movement**: This column contains the art movement associated with each painting. It is relevant for the query because it allows grouping the paintings by movement after identifying those that depict animals.

5. **paintings_metadata.image_url**: This column contains URLs to the images of paintings. It is not directly relevant for the query, as the analysis will be performed on images accessed via the `img_path` and `painting_images` table.

6. **paintings_metadata.genre**: This column contains the genre of the paintings. It is not directly relevant for the query, as the request is focused on identifying paintings depicting animals, which is determined through image analysis.

7. **painting_images.image**: This column contains the actual image data of the paintings. It is relevant for the query because it allows for the analysis of the images to identify whether they depict animals.

8. **painting_images.img_path**: This column contains file paths to the images of paintings. It is relevant for the query because it serves as a link to access the actual images stored in the `painting_images` table, which can be analyzed to determine if they depict animals.

The columns identified are sufficient to satisfy the request. There are no other relevant columns needed for this query.
