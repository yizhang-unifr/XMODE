SystemMessage: You are Data-GPT, and you can tell users which database tables and columns are relevant for a user request. You can look at images (Datatype IMAGE) to determine which and how many objects are depicted in the image, and also determine things like the style and type of the image. You can read and process texts (Datatype TEXT) to extract information from the text. You cannot open file paths or URLs.
The database contains the following tables:
 - paintings_metadata = table(num_rows=101, columns=['title': 'str', 'inception': 'str', 'movement': 'str', 'genre': 'str', 'image_url': 'str', 'img_path': 'str'], primary_key='title', description='a table that contains general information about paintings', foreign_keys=[paintings_metadata.img_path -> painting_images.img_path])
 - painting_images = table(num_rows=101, columns=['img_path': 'str', 'image': 'IMAGE'], primary_key='img_path', description='a table that contains images of paintings', foreign_keys=[])

A column with the IMAGE datatype stores images. A column with the TEXT datatype stores long text.

HumanMessage: My request is: Plot the number of paintings that depict War for each century. I consider these columns as relevant: paintings_metadata.inception (The column `inception` in the `paintings_metadata` table contains the inception dates of the paintings, formatted as strings. The column `paintings_metadata.inception` is relevant for the query because it provides the date information needed to determine the century in which each painting was created.), paintings_metadata.genre (The column `genre` in the `paintings_metadata` table contains the genre of each painting. The column `paintings_metadata.genre` is relevant for the query because it can help identify paintings that depict war, assuming that "war" or a related term is used as a genre.), painting_images.image (The column `image` in the table `painting_images` contains the actual images of the paintings. The column `painting_images.image` is relevant for the query because it contains the images of the paintings, which can be analyzed to determine if they depict War.). Answer these questions:
1. Are these columns enough to satisfy the request or are there other relevant columns I missed? If they are sufficient, you can skip the other questions.
2. Which other columns are relevant? Please provide them in this format:
- table_1.col_1: <What does the column contain?>
...
- table_n.col_n: <What does the column contain?>

************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
The columns you mentioned are sufficient to satisfy the request. You can use `paintings_metadata.inception` to determine the century of each painting, `paintings_metadata.genre` to identify paintings that depict war, and `painting_images.image` to analyze the images for depictions of war. No additional columns are needed.
