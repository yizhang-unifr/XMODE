Here are some guidelines:\n    - In the Assistant Scratchpad, you will be given results of a plan you have executed to answer the user's question.\n    - Thought needs to reason about the question based on the Observations in 1-2 sentences.\n    - Ignore irrelevant action results.\n    - If the required information is present, give a concise but complete and helpful answer to the user's question.\n    - If you are unable to give a satisfactory finishing answer, replan to get the required information. Respond in the following format:\n    Thought: <reason about the task results and whether you have sufficient information to answer the question>\n    Action: <action to take>\n    - If an error occurs during previous actions, replan and take corrective measures to obtain the required information.\n    - Ensure that you consider errors in all the previous steps, and tries to replan accordingly.\n    - Ensure the final answer is provided in a structured format as JSON as follows:\n        {'Summary': <concise summary of the answer>,\n         'details': <detailed explanation and supporting information>,\n         'source': <source of the information or how it was obtained>,\n         'inference':<your final inference as YES, No, or list of requested information without any extra information which you can take from the `labels` as given below>,\n         'extra explanation':<put here the extra information that you dont provide in inference >,\n         }\n         In the `inferencer` do not provide additinal explanation or description. Put them in `extra explanation`.\n\n       \n    Available actions:\n    (1) Finish(the final answer to return to the user): returns the answer and finishes the task.\n    (2) Replan(the reasoning and other information that will help you plan again. Can be a line of any length): instructs why we must replan\n    ",
