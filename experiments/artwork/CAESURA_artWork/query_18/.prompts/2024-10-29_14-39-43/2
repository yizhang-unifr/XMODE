SystemMessage: You are Data-GPT, and you can tell users which database tables and columns are relevant for a user request. You can look at images (Datatype IMAGE) to determine which and how many objects are depicted in the image, and also determine things like the style and type of the image. You can read and process texts (Datatype TEXT) to extract information from the text. You cannot open file paths or URLs.
The database contains the following tables:
 - paintings_metadata = table(num_rows=101, columns=['title': 'str', 'inception': 'str', 'movement': 'str', 'genre': 'str', 'image_url': 'str', 'img_path': 'str'], primary_key='title', description='a table that contains general information about paintings', foreign_keys=[paintings_metadata.img_path -> painting_images.img_path])
 - painting_images = table(num_rows=101, columns=['img_path': 'str', 'image': 'IMAGE'], primary_key='img_path', description='a table that contains images of paintings', foreign_keys=[])

A column with the IMAGE datatype stores images. A column with the TEXT datatype stores long text.

HumanMessage: My request is: Get the number of paintings for each year. I consider these columns as relevant: paintings_metadata.img_path (What is contained in column img_path (table paintings_metadata, datatype str)?. Why or why not is column paintings_metadata.img_path relevant for the query?), paintings_metadata.inception (What is contained in column inception (table paintings_metadata, datatype str)?. Why or why not is column paintings_metadata.inception relevant for the query?), paintings_metadata.title (What is contained in column title (table paintings_metadata, datatype str)?. Why or why not is column paintings_metadata.title relevant for the query?), paintings_metadata.movement (What is contained in column movement (table paintings_metadata, datatype str)?. Why or why not is column paintings_metadata.movement relevant for the query?), paintings_metadata.image_url (What is contained in column image_url (table paintings_metadata, datatype str)?. Why or why not is column paintings_metadata.image_url relevant for the query?), paintings_metadata.genre (What is contained in column genre (table paintings_metadata, datatype str)?. Why or why not is column paintings_metadata.genre relevant for the query?). Answer these questions:
1. Are these columns enough to satisfy the request or are there other relevant columns I missed? If they are sufficient, you can skip the other questions.
2. Which other columns are relevant? Please provide them in this format:
- table_1.col_1: <What does the column contain?>
...
- table_n.col_n: <What does the column contain?>

************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
To satisfy the request of getting the number of paintings for each year, the relevant column is:

- `paintings_metadata.inception`: This column contains the year or date of inception of each painting. It is directly relevant to the query as it provides the information needed to group and count the paintings by year.

The other columns mentioned are not directly relevant to the query:

- `paintings_metadata.img_path`: This column contains the file path to the image of the painting. It is not relevant for counting paintings by year.
- `paintings_metadata.title`: This column contains the title of the painting. It is not relevant for counting paintings by year.
- `paintings_metadata.movement`: This column contains the art movement associated with the painting. It is not relevant for counting paintings by year.
- `paintings_metadata.image_url`: This column contains the URL to the image of the painting. It is not relevant for counting paintings by year.
- `paintings_metadata.genre`: This column contains the genre of the painting. It is not relevant for counting paintings by year.

No other columns are needed to satisfy the request. The `paintings_metadata.inception` column is sufficient to determine the number of paintings for each year.
