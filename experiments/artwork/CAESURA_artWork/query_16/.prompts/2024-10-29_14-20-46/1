SystemMessage: You are Data-GPT, and you can tell users which database tables and columns are relevant for a user request. You can look at images (image) to determine which and how many objects are depicted in the image, and also determine things like the style and type of the image. You cannot open file paths or URLs.
The database contains the following tables:
 - paintings_metadata = table(num_rows=101, columns=['title': 'str', 'inception': 'str', 'movement': 'str', 'genre': 'str', 'image_url': 'str', 'img_path': 'str'], primary_key='title', description='a table that contains general information about paintings', foreign_keys=[paintings_metadata.img_path -> painting_images.img_path])
 - painting_images = table(num_rows=101, columns=['img_path': 'str', 'image': 'IMAGE'], primary_key='img_path', description='a table that contains images of paintings', foreign_keys=[])

A column with the IMAGE datatype stores images. A column with the TEXT datatype stores long text.

Table 'painting_images' =
img_path: datasets/art/images/img_89.jpg | image: <IMAGE stored at 'datasets/art/images/img_89.jpg'>
img_path: datasets/art/images/img_41.jpg | image: <IMAGE stored at 'datasets/art/images/img_41.jpg'>
img_path: datasets/art/images/img_19.jpg | image: <IMAGE stored at 'datasets/art/images/img_19.jpg'>
img_path: datasets/art/images/img_28.jpg | image: <IMAGE stored at 'datasets/art/images/img_28.jpg'>
img_path: datasets/art/images/img_30.jpg | image: <IMAGE stored at 'datasets/art/images/img_30.jpg'>
 and 96 more rows.

HumanMessage: My request is: Get the number of paintings that depict Fruit for each century.
In order to plan the steps to do, You must answer the following questions as precisely as possible.
1. If a plot is requested, what kind of plot is most suitable? What would be the best representation for the requested plot?   What exactly is plotted on the X and Y-Axis? Answer N/A if not applicable.
2. If a table is requested, what should be the columns of the table? What should be the rows of the table? Answer N/A if not applicable.
3.0.1 What is contained in column img_path (table painting_images, datatype str) ?
3.0.2 Why or why not is column painting_images.img_path relevant for the query (Data-GPT can transform these values or extract relevant parts, in case they are not yet in the right format.)?.
3.0.3 Final decision whether column painting_images.img_path is relevant (Yes / No).

3.1.1 What is contained in column image (table painting_images, datatype IMAGE) ?
3.1.2 Why or why not is column painting_images.image relevant for the query (Data-GPT can easily extract structured information from these images.)?.
3.1.3 Final decision whether column painting_images.image is relevant (Yes / No).

************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
1. If a plot is requested, the most suitable kind of plot would be a bar chart. The best representation for the requested plot would be to have the centuries on the X-axis and the number of paintings depicting fruit on the Y-axis.

2. If a table is requested, the columns of the table should be "Century" and "Number of Paintings Depicting Fruit". The rows of the table should represent each century with the corresponding count of paintings depicting fruit.

3.0.1 The column `img_path` in the table `painting_images` contains file paths to the images of paintings.

3.0.2 The column `painting_images.img_path` is relevant for the query because it provides the file paths to the images, which can be used to access and analyze the images to determine if they depict fruit.

3.0.3 Final decision whether column `painting_images.img_path` is relevant: Yes.

3.1.1 The column `image` in the table `painting_images` contains the actual image data of the paintings.

3.1.2 The column `painting_images.image` is relevant for the query because it contains the images that need to be analyzed to determine if they depict fruit.

3.1.3 Final decision whether column `painting_images.image` is relevant: Yes.
