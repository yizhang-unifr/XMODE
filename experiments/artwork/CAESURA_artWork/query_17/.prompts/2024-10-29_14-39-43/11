Step 4: Plan completed.


The database contains the following tables:
 - paintings_metadata = table(num_rows=101, columns=['title': 'str', 'inception': 'str', 'movement': 'str', 'genre': 'str', 'image_url': 'str', 'img_path': 'str'], primary_key='title', description='a table that contains general information about paintings', foreign_keys=[paintings_metadata.img_path -> painting_images.img_path])
 - painting_images = table(num_rows=101, columns=['img_path': 'str', 'image': 'IMAGE'], primary_key='img_path', description='a table that contains images of paintings', foreign_keys=[])

A column with the IMAGE datatype stores images. A column with the TEXT datatype stores long text.

You have the following capabilities:
You are able to look at images (columns of type IMAGE). For example, you are able to do things like:
 - Recognize the objects depicted in images. E.g. You can determine in which images a skateboard is depicted.
 - Recognize the style of the image. E.g. You can determine whether the image is a photograph or pixel art or ...
 - You can count the number of objects of a certain type. E.g. You can count all marbles depicted in an image.
 - You can look at images both to add new columns to a table (e.g. num_marbles) or to select rows based on images (e.g. all rows where image depicts a skateboard).
 - ...
 Template 1: Extract <what to extract from each individual image, e.g. the number of marbles depicted> for each image in <column, e.g. images>.
 Template 2: Select all rows where <column, e.g. images> depicts <description about what should be depicted>.

You are able to read and understand longer texts (columns of type TEXT). For example, you are able to do things like:
 - Extract relevant information from texts. E.g. in a patient report, you can extract the patient, diagnosis, treatment, ...
 - You can read texts both to add new columns to a table (e.g. diagnosis) or to select rows based on the text (e.g. all rows where diagnosis is fever).
 - ...
Template: Extract <what to extract from each individual text, e.g. the age / diagnosis / treatment> for each <class of entity, e.g. patient> from <column, e.g. patient_report in table joined_patient_table>.

You are able to transform the values in a column. For example, you are able to do things like:
 - In a column containing dates, you are able to extract the day, month, year etc.
 - In a column containing names, you are able to transform all strings to upper case, lower case etc.
 - ....
Template 1: Extract <what to extract from each individual value, e.g. the year> from each value in <column, e.g. date_of_birth>.
Template 2: Transform the values in <column, e.g. name> to <description of transformation, e.g. lower case>

You are able to manipulate the tables in a SQL like manner. For example you are able to:
- Select rows that match a certain criterion. E.g. You can select all rows where the value of a column is larger than a threshold, an image column depicts a skateboard or the text is a patient report. Per step, you are only allowed to select based on a single column.
- Project columns to dismiss irrelevant columns.
- Join two tables to combine them. You can do all typical joins, like inner joins, left joins, right joins etc.
- Aggregate rows. E.g. You can group a patients table based on their diagnosis to compute the average age for each diagnosis.
Template: <Select/Project/Join/Group> <description of operation>

You are able to produce plots if the user requests one. You can produce bar plots, scatter plots and line plots.
In order to produce a plot, the data must be prepared using the other tools. The input for plotting is a table with two columns and one of those columns will be plotted on the X-Axis and the other on the Y-Axis.
Template: Plot the <table name, e.g. result_table> table in a bar plot. The <column X, e.g. diagnosis> should be on the X-axis and the <column Y, e.g. mean_age> on the Y-Axis.


Use the following format:
Request: The user request you must satisfy by using your capabilities
Thought: You should always think what to do.
Step 1: Description of the step.
Input: List of tables passed as input. Usually this is a single table, except when tables need to be combined using a join.
Output: Name of the output table. N/A if there is no output e.g. when plotting.
New Columns: The new columns that have been added to the dataset. N/A if no column has been added.
... (this Step/Input/Output/New Columns can repeat N times)
Step N: Plan completed.

AIMessage: To get the number of paintings that depict animals for each movement, I need to first identify which paintings depict animals by examining the images. Then, I will join the relevant tables to associate these paintings with their respective movements and count the occurrences.

Step 1: Select all rows from the 'painting_images' table where the 'image' column depicts animals.
Input: painting_images
Output: animal_paintings
New Columns: N/A

Step 2: Join the 'animal_paintings' table with the 'paintings_metadata' table on the 'img_path' column to associate each painting with its metadata, including the movement.
Input: animal_paintings, paintings_metadata
Output: joined_animal_paintings
New Columns: N/A

Step 3: Group the 'joined_animal_paintings' table by the 'movement' column and count the number of paintings in each group.
Input: joined_animal_paintings
Output: result_table
New Columns: num_paintings

Step 4: Plan completed.

HumanMessage: Something went wrong in Step 1! Empty table encountered. Check your filter or join conditions. 
This is how it can be fixed: Explain in detail how this error could be fixed.
   - Verify that the description used in the Image Select tool is appropriate and matches the content of the images.
   - Consider using the Visual Question Answering tool to first extract information about what is depicted in the images, and then filter based on that information.
   - Ensure that the images in the 'painting_images' table actually contain depictions of animals. 
Please come up with a fixed plan.

Request: Get the number of paintings that depict Animals for each movement.
Thought: To fix the issue, I need to ensure that the process of identifying paintings depicting animals is accurate. I will use the Visual Question Answering tool to extract information about what is depicted in the images, and then filter based on that information. This will help ensure that the correct paintings are selected.

Step 1: Extract information about what is depicted in each image in the 'image' column of the 'painting_images' table to determine if animals are present.
Input: painting_images
Output: animal_info
New Columns: depicts_animals

Step 2: Select all rows from the 'animal_info' table where the 'depicts_animals' column indicates that animals are depicted.
Input: animal_info
Output: animal_paintings
New Columns: N/A

Step 3: Join the 'animal_paintings' table with the 'paintings_metadata' table on the 'img_path' column to associate each painting with its metadata, including the movement.
Input: animal_paintings, paintings_metadata
Output: joined_animal_paintings
New Columns: N/A

Step 4: Group the 'joined_animal_paintings' table by the 'movement' column and count the number of paintings in each group.
Input: joined_animal_paintings
Output: result_table
New Columns: num_paintings

Step 5: Plan completed.
