SystemMessage: You are Data-GPT, and you execute informal query plans using a set of tools:
The database contains the following tables:
 - paintings_metadata = table(num_rows=101, columns=['title': 'str', 'inception': 'str', 'movement': 'str', 'genre': 'str', 'image_url': 'str', 'img_path': 'str'], primary_key='title', description='a table that contains general information about paintings', foreign_keys=[paintings_metadata.img_path -> painting_images.img_path])
 - painting_images = table(num_rows=101, columns=['img_path': 'str', 'image': 'IMAGE'], primary_key='img_path', description='a table that contains images of paintings', foreign_keys=[])

A column with the IMAGE datatype stores images. A column with the TEXT datatype stores long text.

You can use the following tools:
Image Select: It is useful for when you want to select tuples based on what is depicted in images (column with IMAGE datatype) e.g. to select all rows where the image depicts a skateboard. Two input arguments: (column with IMAGE datatype; the description to match), e.g. (image; skateboard). The tool selects the tuples where the images match the description. It will not add new columns to the table.

Visual Question Answering: It is useful for when you want to know what is depicted on the images in a column with IMAGE datatype. It is Data-GPTs way of looking at images. The input to the tool is: (name of column with IMAGE datatype; name of new column with extracted info; question; datatype to automatically cast the result column to [string, int, float, date, boolean]), e.g. (image; breed_of_dog; What is the breed of dog?; string). The tool adds a new column to the table with the extracted information (e.g. [Poodle, Chihuahua, ...]). The question can be anything that can be answered by looking at an image: E.g. How many <x> are depicted? Is <y> depicted? What is in the background? ...

SQL: Useful for when you want to query tables using SQL in SQLite syntax. The input to the tool is: (query referencing tables in the database). The result of the tool is the result table of the SQL query. For example if you want to combine two tables, you can join them using a SQL query. If you want to an aggregation, you can issue a SQL-Query using GROUP BY, etc.

Python: Transform the values for a certain column using python. Can be used to transform dates, numbers etc, or to extract data from semi-structured documents. Three input arguments: (column to transform; new name for the transformed column; natural language explanation of the python code to be executed). For example: (date_of_birth; month_of_birth; extract the month from the dates) Cannot deal columns of type IMAGE or TEXT. Cannot filter rows. Has only access to the libraries pandas,datetime,numpy,re.

Plot: Plot the results, if the user asks for a plot. Three input arguments (Type of Plot [scatter, line, bar]; column on x axis; column on y axis). Unfortunately, is it not possible to customize the labels, color, title, axes etc.

Text Question Answering: It is useful for when you want to extract information from texts inside of columns of TEXT datatype. It is Data-GPTs way of reading texts. Four input arguments: (name of column with TEXT datatype; name of new column; question_template; datatype), e.g. (patient_report; diagnosis; What is the diagnosis of <patient_name>?; string), where 'patient_name' is a column from the same table as patient_report. The question_template can be anything that can be answered by reading a text. Importantly, the question_template is a template, and must reference columns from the same table in <>. The values from this column will then be inserted into the question. The tool will automatically convert the extracted information to the specified datatype [should be one of string, int, float, date, boolean]. The tool adds a new column to the table with the extracted information (e.g. [fever, sore throat, ...]) from each individual text.

No Op: Does not perform any operation. Useful when you should extract a column from the table, but this column already exists. E.g. Step X: Extract name from persons --> Column name already exists in Table persons. Hence, no operation necessary.

Use the following output format:
Step <i>: What to do in this step?
Reasoning: Reason about which tool should be used for this step. Take datatypes into account.
Tool: The tool to use, should be one of [Image Select, Visual Question Answering, SQL, Python, Plot, Text Question Answering, No Op]
Arguments: The arguments to call the tool, separated by ';'. Should be (arg_1; ...; arg_n)
(if you need more than one tool for this step, follow up with another Tool + Arguments.)

HumanMessage: Execute the steps one by one. These columns (among others) are potentially relevant:
- The 'image' column of the 'painting_images' table might be relevant. The column `image` in the `painting_images` table contains the actual image data of the paintings. These are some relevant values for the column: ["<IMAGE stored at 'datasets/art/images/img_89.jpg'>", "<IMAGE stored at 'datasets/art/images/img_41.jpg'>", "<IMAGE stored at 'datasets/art/images/img_19.jpg'>"]. Use Visual Question Answering to look at the images in painting_images.image and extract information. Use Image Select to filter rows by what is depicted on the images.
- The columns paintings_metadata.title (example values ['Predella of the Barbadori altarpiece', 'Judith']), paintings_metadata.inception (example values ['1438-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1525-01-01T00:00:00Z']), paintings_metadata.genre (example values ['religious art', 'nude']) might also be relevant.. Take these into account when executing the tools.
Step 1: Select all rows from the 'paintings_metadata' table where the 'genre' column is 'religious art'. The input to this step is the 'paintings_metadata' table.

--
AIMessage: Reasoning: To filter rows based on a specific value in a column, the SQL tool is appropriate. We need to select rows where the 'genre' column is 'religious art'.

Tool: SQL

Arguments: SELECT * FROM paintings_metadata WHERE genre = 'religious art'

--
HumanMessage: Observation. Table religious_art_paintings has been added.
The table religious_art_paintings has these columns: ['title', 'inception', 'movement', 'genre', 'image_url', 'img_path']
The table religious_art_paintings has 54 rows.

--
HumanMessage: Step 2: Sort the 'religious_art_paintings' table by the 'inception' column in ascending order to find the oldest artwork. The input to this step is the 'religious_art_paintings' table.

--
AIMessage: Reasoning: To sort a table based on a specific column, the SQL tool is appropriate. We need to sort the 'religious_art_paintings' table by the 'inception' column in ascending order.

Tool: SQL

Arguments: SELECT * FROM religious_art_paintings ORDER BY inception ASC

--
HumanMessage: Observation. Table sorted_religious_art_paintings has been added.
The table sorted_religious_art_paintings has these columns: ['title', 'inception', 'movement', 'genre', 'image_url', 'img_path']
The table sorted_religious_art_paintings has 54 rows.

--
HumanMessage: Step 3: Select the first row from the 'sorted_religious_art_paintings' table to get the oldest religious artwork. The input to this step is the 'sorted_religious_art_paintings' table.

--
AIMessage: Reasoning: To select the first row from a sorted table, the SQL tool is appropriate. We need to select the first row from the 'sorted_religious_art_paintings' table.

Tool: SQL

Arguments: SELECT * FROM sorted_religious_art_paintings LIMIT 1

--
HumanMessage: Observation. Table oldest_religious_artwork has been added.
The table oldest_religious_artwork has these columns: ['title', 'inception', 'movement', 'genre', 'image_url', 'img_path']
The table oldest_religious_artwork has 1 rows.

--
HumanMessage: Step 4: Join the 'oldest_religious_artwork' table with the 'painting_images' table on the 'img_path' column to get the image of the oldest religious artwork. The input to this step are the oldest_religious_artwork, painting_images tables.
************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
Reasoning: To combine two tables based on a common column, the SQL tool is appropriate. We need to join the 'oldest_religious_artwork' table with the 'painting_images' table on the 'img_path' column to get the image of the oldest religious artwork.

Tool: SQL

Arguments: SELECT * FROM oldest_religious_artwork JOIN painting_images ON oldest_religious_artwork.img_path = painting_images.img_path
