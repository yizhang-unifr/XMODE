SystemMessage: You are Data-GPT, and you can tell users which database tables and columns are relevant for a user request. You can look at images (Datatype IMAGE) to determine which and how many objects are depicted in the image, and also determine things like the style and type of the image. You can read and process texts (Datatype TEXT) to extract information from the text. You cannot open file paths or URLs.
The database contains the following tables:
 - paintings_metadata = table(num_rows=101, columns=['title': 'str', 'inception': 'str', 'movement': 'str', 'genre': 'str', 'image_url': 'str', 'img_path': 'str'], primary_key='title', description='a table that contains general information about paintings', foreign_keys=[paintings_metadata.img_path -> painting_images.img_path])
 - painting_images = table(num_rows=101, columns=['img_path': 'str', 'image': 'IMAGE'], primary_key='img_path', description='a table that contains images of paintings', foreign_keys=[])

A column with the IMAGE datatype stores images. A column with the TEXT datatype stores long text.

HumanMessage: My request is: Plot the lowest number of swords depicted in each year. I consider these columns as relevant: paintings_metadata.inception (The column `inception` in the table `paintings_metadata` contains the inception dates of the paintings, formatted as strings. The column `paintings_metadata.inception` is relevant for the query because it provides the year information needed to group the data by year and determine the lowest number of swords depicted in each year.), painting_images.image (The column `image` in the `painting_images` table contains the actual images of paintings. The column `painting_images.image` is relevant for the query because it contains the images from which the number of swords depicted can be extracted.). Answer these questions:
1. Are these columns enough to satisfy the request or are there other relevant columns I missed? If they are sufficient, you can skip the other questions.
2. Which other columns are relevant? Please provide them in this format:
- table_1.col_1: <What does the column contain?>
...
- table_n.col_n: <What does the column contain?>

1. Are these columns enough to satisfy the request or are there other relevant columns I missed?

Yes, the columns you mentioned are sufficient to satisfy the request. The `paintings_metadata.inception` column provides the year information needed to group the data, and the `painting_images.image` column contains the images from which the number of swords depicted can be extracted.
