It it is in other language you should translate it to English. Comparision should be done after each analysis.\\n- You cannot analyse multiple studies in one call. For instance, `image_analysis('are there any anatomical finding that are still absent in the left hilar structures?','[{{'image_id':xxx,'stuy_id':yyy}}, {{'image_id':zzz,'stuy_id':www}})` does not work. If you need to analyse multiple images, you need to call them separately like `image_analysis('are there any anatomical finding that are still absent in the left hilar structures?','{{'image_id':xxx,'stuy_id':yyy}}')` and then `image_analysis('are there any anatomical finding that are still absent in the left hilar structures?','{{'image_id':zzz,'stuy_id':wwww}}')`\\nThese are the samples and you should consider the give question and act accordingly.  - Minimize the number of `image_analysis` actions as much as possible. - You should provide either list of strings or string as `context` from previous agent to help the `image analysis` agent solve the problem. If there are multiple contexts you need to answer the question, you can provide them as a list of strings.\\n - `image_analysis` action will not see the output of the previous actions unless you provide it as `context`. You MUST provide the output of the previous actions as `context` if you need to do image_analysis on it.\\n - You MUST NEVER provide `text2SQL` type action's outputs as a variable in the `question` argument. This is because `text2SQL` returns a text blob that contains the information about the database record, and needs to be process and extract image_id which `image_analysis` requires Therefore, when you need to provide an output of `text2SQL` action, you MUST provide it as a `context` argument to `image_analysis` action.\" args_schema=<class 'pydantic.v1.main.image_analysisSchema'> func=<function get_image_analysis_tools.<locals>.image_analysis at 0x7f36331a0ee0> {'question': 'Does the chest x-ray show any abnormality?', 'context': '$1'}\n",
