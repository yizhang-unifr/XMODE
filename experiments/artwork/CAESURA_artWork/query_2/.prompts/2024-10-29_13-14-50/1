SystemMessage: You are Data-GPT, and you can tell users which database tables and columns are relevant for a user request. You can look at images (image) to determine which and how many objects are depicted in the image, and also determine things like the style and type of the image. You cannot open file paths or URLs.
The database contains the following tables:
 - paintings_metadata = table(num_rows=101, columns=['title': 'str', 'inception': 'str', 'movement': 'str', 'genre': 'str', 'image_url': 'str', 'img_path': 'str'], primary_key='title', description='a table that contains general information about paintings', foreign_keys=[paintings_metadata.img_path -> painting_images.img_path])
 - painting_images = table(num_rows=101, columns=['img_path': 'str', 'image': 'IMAGE'], primary_key='img_path', description='a table that contains images of paintings', foreign_keys=[])

A column with the IMAGE datatype stores images. A column with the TEXT datatype stores long text.

Table 'painting_images' =
img_path: datasets/art/images/img_89.jpg | image: <IMAGE stored at 'datasets/art/images/img_89.jpg'>
img_path: datasets/art/images/img_41.jpg | image: <IMAGE stored at 'datasets/art/images/img_41.jpg'>
img_path: datasets/art/images/img_19.jpg | image: <IMAGE stored at 'datasets/art/images/img_19.jpg'>
img_path: datasets/art/images/img_28.jpg | image: <IMAGE stored at 'datasets/art/images/img_28.jpg'>
img_path: datasets/art/images/img_30.jpg | image: <IMAGE stored at 'datasets/art/images/img_30.jpg'>
 and 96 more rows.

HumanMessage: My request is: What is the movement of the painting that depicts the highest number of swords?.
In order to plan the steps to do, You must answer the following questions as precisely as possible.
1. If a plot is requested, what kind of plot is most suitable? What would be the best representation for the requested plot?   What exactly is plotted on the X and Y-Axis? Answer N/A if not applicable.
2. If a table is requested, what should be the columns of the table? What should be the rows of the table? Answer N/A if not applicable.
3.0.1 What is contained in column img_path (table painting_images, datatype str) ?
3.0.2 Why or why not is column painting_images.img_path relevant for the query (Data-GPT can transform these values or extract relevant parts, in case they are not yet in the right format.)?.
3.0.3 Final decision whether column painting_images.img_path is relevant (Yes / No).

3.1.1 What is contained in column image (table painting_images, datatype IMAGE) ?
3.1.2 Why or why not is column painting_images.image relevant for the query (Data-GPT can easily extract structured information from these images.)?.
3.1.3 Final decision whether column painting_images.image is relevant (Yes / No).

1. N/A

2. N/A

3.0.1 The column `img_path` in the `painting_images` table contains file paths to images of paintings stored in the database.

3.0.2 The column `painting_images.img_path` is relevant for the query because it serves as a link between the `painting_images` table and the `paintings_metadata` table. It allows us to associate each image with its corresponding metadata, which includes the movement of the painting.

3.0.3 Final decision whether column `painting_images.img_path` is relevant: Yes.

3.1.1 The column `image` in the `painting_images` table contains the actual images of the paintings.

3.1.2 The column `painting_images.image` is relevant for the query because it allows us to analyze the images to determine the number of swords depicted in each painting. This information is crucial to identify the painting with the highest number of swords.

3.1.3 Final decision whether column `painting_images.image` is relevant: Yes.
