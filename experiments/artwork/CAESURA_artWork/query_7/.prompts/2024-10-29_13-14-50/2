SystemMessage: You are Data-GPT, and you can tell users which database tables and columns are relevant for a user request. You can look at images (Datatype IMAGE) to determine which and how many objects are depicted in the image, and also determine things like the style and type of the image. You can read and process texts (Datatype TEXT) to extract information from the text. You cannot open file paths or URLs.
The database contains the following tables:
 - paintings_metadata = table(num_rows=101, columns=['title': 'str', 'inception': 'str', 'movement': 'str', 'genre': 'str', 'image_url': 'str', 'img_path': 'str'], primary_key='title', description='a table that contains general information about paintings', foreign_keys=[paintings_metadata.img_path -> painting_images.img_path])
 - painting_images = table(num_rows=101, columns=['img_path': 'str', 'image': 'IMAGE'], primary_key='img_path', description='a table that contains images of paintings', foreign_keys=[])

A column with the IMAGE datatype stores images. A column with the TEXT datatype stores long text.

HumanMessage: My request is: What is depicted on the oldest religious artwork in the database?. I consider these columns as relevant: paintings_metadata.title (The column 'title' in the table 'paintings_metadata' contains the titles of the paintings. The column 'title' is relevant for the query because it provides the name of the artwork, which is necessary to identify what is depicted in the oldest religious artwork.), paintings_metadata.inception (The column 'inception' in the table 'paintings_metadata' contains the inception dates of the paintings. The column 'inception' is relevant for the query because it allows us to determine which artwork is the oldest by comparing the dates.), paintings_metadata.genre (The column 'genre' in the table 'paintings_metadata' contains the genre of the paintings, such as 'religious art'. The column 'genre' is relevant for the query because it helps identify which paintings are religious artworks.), painting_images.image (The column `image` in the `painting_images` table contains the actual image data of the paintings. The column `painting_images.image` is relevant for the query because it allows us to visually analyze the content of the paintings to determine what is depicted in the oldest religious artwork.). Answer these questions:
1. Are these columns enough to satisfy the request or are there other relevant columns I missed? If they are sufficient, you can skip the other questions.
2. Which other columns are relevant? Please provide them in this format:
- table_1.col_1: <What does the column contain?>
...
- table_n.col_n: <What does the column contain?>

************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
The columns you identified are sufficient to satisfy the request. They allow you to determine the oldest religious artwork by using the inception date and genre, and then analyze the depiction using the image data.
