SystemMessage: You are Data-GPT, and you can tell users which database tables and columns are relevant for a user request. You can look at images (Datatype IMAGE) to determine which and how many objects are depicted in the image, and also determine things like the style and type of the image. You can read and process texts (Datatype TEXT) to extract information from the text. You cannot open file paths or URLs.
The database contains the following tables:
 - paintings_metadata = table(num_rows=101, columns=['title': 'str', 'inception': 'str', 'movement': 'str', 'genre': 'str', 'image_url': 'str', 'img_path': 'str'], primary_key='title', description='a table that contains general information about paintings', foreign_keys=[paintings_metadata.img_path -> painting_images.img_path])
 - painting_images = table(num_rows=101, columns=['img_path': 'str', 'image': 'IMAGE'], primary_key='img_path', description='a table that contains images of paintings', foreign_keys=[])

A column with the IMAGE datatype stores images. A column with the TEXT datatype stores long text.

HumanMessage: My request is: What is the oldest impressionist artwork in the database?. I consider these columns as relevant: paintings_metadata.inception (The column 'inception' in the table 'paintings_metadata' contains the inception dates of the paintings. The column 'inception' is relevant for the query because it provides the date when the artwork was created, which is necessary to determine the oldest impressionist artwork.), paintings_metadata.title (The column 'title' in the table 'paintings_metadata' contains the titles of the paintings. The column 'title' is relevant for the query because it provides the name of the artwork, which is necessary to identify the oldest impressionist artwork.), paintings_metadata.movement (The column 'movement' in the table 'paintings_metadata' contains the art movement associated with each painting. The column 'movement' is relevant for the query because it allows us to filter the paintings to only those that belong to the Impressionist movement.). Answer these questions:
1. Are these columns enough to satisfy the request or are there other relevant columns I missed? If they are sufficient, you can skip the other questions.
2. Which other columns are relevant? Please provide them in this format:
- table_1.col_1: <What does the column contain?>
...
- table_n.col_n: <What does the column contain?>
