SystemMessage: You are Data-GPT, and you can tell users which database tables and columns are relevant for a user request. You can look at images (Datatype IMAGE) to determine which and how many objects are depicted in the image, and also determine things like the style and type of the image. You can read and process texts (Datatype TEXT) to extract information from the text. You cannot open file paths or URLs.
The database contains the following tables:
 - paintings_metadata = table(num_rows=101, columns=['title': 'str', 'inception': 'str', 'movement': 'str', 'genre': 'str', 'image_url': 'str', 'img_path': 'str'], primary_key='title', description='a table that contains general information about paintings', foreign_keys=[paintings_metadata.img_path -> painting_images.img_path])
 - painting_images = table(num_rows=101, columns=['img_path': 'str', 'image': 'IMAGE'], primary_key='img_path', description='a table that contains images of paintings', foreign_keys=[])

A column with the IMAGE datatype stores images. A column with the TEXT datatype stores long text.

HumanMessage: My request is: Get the number of paintings that depict Fruit for each century. I consider these columns as relevant: paintings_metadata.inception (The column `inception` in the table `paintings_metadata` contains the inception dates of the paintings, formatted as strings. The column `paintings_metadata.inception` is relevant for the query because it provides the date information needed to determine the century in which each painting was created.), paintings_metadata.genre (The column `genre` in the table `paintings_metadata` contains the genre of each painting. The column `paintings_metadata.genre` is relevant for the query because it may contain information about the subject matter of the painting, such as whether it depicts fruit.), painting_images.image (The column `image` in the table `painting_images` contains the actual image data of the paintings. The column `painting_images.image` is relevant for the query because it contains the images that need to be analyzed to determine if they depict fruit.), painting_images.img_path (The column `img_path` in the table `painting_images` contains file paths to the images of paintings. The column `painting_images.img_path` is relevant for the query because it provides the file paths to the images, which can be used to access and analyze the images to determine if they depict fruit.). Answer these questions:
1. Are these columns enough to satisfy the request or are there other relevant columns I missed? If they are sufficient, you can skip the other questions.
2. Which other columns are relevant? Please provide them in this format:
- table_1.col_1: <What does the column contain?>
...
- table_n.col_n: <What does the column contain?>

AIMessage: The columns you have identified are sufficient to satisfy the request. You have covered the necessary columns to determine the century of each painting (`paintings_metadata.inception`), to identify paintings that may depict fruit based on genre (`paintings_metadata.genre`), and to analyze the images to confirm the depiction of fruit (`painting_images.image`). Therefore, you can skip the other questions.

The columns you have identified are indeed sufficient to satisfy the request. You have covered:

- `paintings_metadata.inception`: Contains the inception dates of the paintings, necessary to determine the century.
- `paintings_metadata.genre`: May contain information about the subject matter, such as whether it depicts fruit.
- `painting_images.image`: Contains the actual image data, which can be analyzed to determine if they depict fruit.
- `painting_images.img_path`: Provides the file paths to the images, linking the metadata to the actual images.

No additional columns are needed for your request.
