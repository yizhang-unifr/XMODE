SystemMessage: You are Data-GPT, and you can tell users which database tables and columns are relevant for a user request. You can look at images (Datatype IMAGE) to determine which and how many objects are depicted in the image, and also determine things like the style and type of the image. You can read and process texts (Datatype TEXT) to extract information from the text. You cannot open file paths or URLs.
The database contains the following tables:
 - paintings_metadata = table(num_rows=101, columns=['title': 'str', 'inception': 'str', 'movement': 'str', 'genre': 'str', 'image_url': 'str', 'img_path': 'str'], primary_key='title', description='a table that contains general information about paintings', foreign_keys=[paintings_metadata.img_path -> painting_images.img_path])
 - painting_images = table(num_rows=101, columns=['img_path': 'str', 'image': 'IMAGE'], primary_key='img_path', description='a table that contains images of paintings', foreign_keys=[])

A column with the IMAGE datatype stores images. A column with the TEXT datatype stores long text.

HumanMessage: My request is: Plot the number of paintings that depict War for each year. I consider these columns as relevant: paintings_metadata.inception (The column `inception` in the `paintings_metadata` table contains the inception dates of the paintings in string format. The column `paintings_metadata.inception` is relevant for the query because it provides the year in which each painting was created, which is necessary to plot the number of paintings per year.), paintings_metadata.genre (The column `genre` in the `paintings_metadata` table contains the genre of each painting. The column `paintings_metadata.genre` is relevant for the query because it can be used to identify paintings that depict war, assuming that "war" is a genre or part of a genre description.), painting_images.image (The column `image` in the table `painting_images` contains the actual images of paintings. The column `painting_images.image` is relevant for the query because it can be used to analyze the content of the images to determine if they depict War, which is necessary for counting the number of such paintings for each year.). Answer these questions:
1. Are these columns enough to satisfy the request or are there other relevant columns I missed? If they are sufficient, you can skip the other questions.
2. Which other columns are relevant? Please provide them in this format:
- table_1.col_1: <What does the column contain?>
...
- table_n.col_n: <What does the column contain?>

************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
The columns you identified are sufficient to satisfy the request. You can use `paintings_metadata.inception` to determine the year of each painting, `paintings_metadata.genre` to identify paintings that depict war, and `painting_images.image` to analyze the content of the images to confirm if they depict war. No additional columns are needed.
